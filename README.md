# Classification-Spotify
The challenge is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict the genre of a song. Genre is a categorical value (in this case a string) so treat this as a classification problem. Ignoring Id and genre (named "top genre"), there are 13 other attributes in the dataset that can be use tod build models. The performance of the model will be determined by the classification accuracy (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs9856-spotify-classification-problem-2024/overview).
